# Forgot to Level up Your Game Dev Law Skill? Let Us Help Out.

We're excited to announce that we've introduced paralegal law services to our offering from today!

We specialise in business/company law and intellectual property law in England and Wales, with experience handling these issues both internally and externally with game developers. In particular, we aim to serve smaller game developers who are looking to continue on their adventure without having to worry about the paperwork.

We've based our rates off the rates recommended by the UK government for our band as paralegal lawyers. We've reduced it significantly from there due to the fact that we're not able to do certain activities under the Legal Services Act 2007 and other legislation in the UK, so we might be a more affordable alternative for independent and small developers if we are able to do what they need to do.

We can do things such as:

* reviewing or drafting most standard contracts like the ones you'll need with independent contractors,
* acting as a Data Protection Officer as required in certain circumstances under the GDPRâ€”this includes required tasks such as security training tailored to your business,
* providing advice on certain areas of the law (for example GDPR when you don't need a DPO),
* and so on.

Please get in touch if you're interested in these or any other legal activity. To speed things up, please briefly explain what you need doing so that we can let you know whether we're able to provide those services to you.
