# Paid or Unpaid?

All jobs are considered unpaid, except where the worker directly receives a predictable income that is cash or another liquid asset that can be reliably, predictably, easily, and readily converted into cash.

And, to clarify, we use the following definitions:
* **reliable** means that the market is a trusted one, and that the chance of that asset becoming impaired, depreciating significantly, being written off, or becoming lost due to fraud is negligible
* **predictable** means that the asset has not had a volatile true and fair value for a significant period up to the date of transfer
* **easy** or **easy to trade** means that few barriers exist to transferring the asset and any that do exist are disclosed upfront—for example:
	* financial barriers may make a conversion difficult, but
	* proof of identity barriers do not inhibit a conversion from being easy
* **readily** means that the asset can be converted at any time after it has been transferred without significant delay

In simple terms, paid work includes:
* Fixed payments per project
* Hourly (or other time-based) rates
* Transfer of cash (electronically or otherwise)
* Shares that can be reliably, predictably, easily, and readily converted into cash
* Transfer of debtors owing now, that can be reliably, predictably, easily, and readily collected

Unpaid work includes:
* Free work
* Revenue share agreements
* Shares in your company, unless they meet the definition included within the paid work examples
* Transfer of "bad debtors" (as these would not meet one or more of the four definitions)

These are just some examples—some of them will be common and others rare, but inevitably some circumstances will be missed. You should use the definition at the top to decide, but if you're unsure then file an issue and someone will decide whether your posting is paid or not.
